    original file's permissions.
  * Cleaned up lits bits of code
  * Fixed an incorrect comment describing the rmchr() function

  -- Bryan Hawkins <spcnvdrr@protonmail.com> Mon, 19 Mar 2018 13:24:45 -0500

spacerm (1.2.7); urgency=low;
  * Added a new option called --dash/-d which replaces spaces with dashes.

  -- Bryan Hawkins <spcnvdrr@protonmail.com> Thu, 01 Feb 2018 11:07:05 -0600


spacerm (1.2.6); urgency=low;
  * Fixed a bug where spacerm would fail silently if the user did not have
    adequate permissions to access the file.
  * Changed the layout of the source code to make it more natural to read.

  -- Bryan Hawkins <spcnvdrr@protonmail.com>   Sat, 1 Jan 2018 13:55:39 -0600

spacerm (1.2.5); urgency=low;
  * Added the --strip option to strip the given characters from the filename
    in addition to spaces. The file extension is not modified, however file
    extensions that contain multiple parts may be modified, .e.g. .tar.gz
    the .tar portion may have characters stripped from it.
  * Fixed a bug that allowed directories and other file types to be renamed if
    specified a certain way. This program only renames regular files.
  * Added a license file making this program licensed under the 3-clause BSD
    license.

  -- Bryan Hawkins <spcnvdrr@protonmail.com>   Sat, 30 Dec 2017 13:55:39 -0600

spacerm (1.2.4); urgency=low:
  * Added a new option to simulate what operation/s would be done. No
    files are actually renamed/copied but the actions that would be performed
    are printed to standard output.

  -- Bryan Hawkins <spcnvdrr@protonmail.com> Wed, 20 Dec 2017 01:24:36 -0600

spacerm (1.2.3); urgency=low:
  * Added a function to find the filename in a given path. It's like my own
    version of the basename function, except it does not modify the
    argument passed to it.
  * Added the --underscore/-u option to replace spaces with underscores.

  -- Bryan Hawkins <spcnvdrr@protonmail.com> Tue, 12 Dec 2017 10:33:49 -0600

spacerm (1.2.2); urgency=low:
  * Fixed a bug in the fixfilename() function that would ignore preceding
    spaces in a filename when run in the same directory as spacerm.
    E.g. spacerm ' file 1' -> ' file1'

  -- Bryan Hawkins <spcnvdrr@protonmail.com> Thu, 07 Dec 2017 01:32:51 -0600

spacerm (1.2.1); urgency=low:
  * Fixed a bug in the fixfilename() function so that spaces are only removed
    from filenames. The bug removed spaces from the entire path in addition to
    the file name which caused the rename() or cpfile() functions to fail
    because of a non-existent path.
    E.g. user/folder 1/file 1 -> user/folder1/file1
